<p>This network visualizes the relationships between hip hop artists from Atlanta and their producers that are found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians_from_Atlanta">this Wikipedia list</a>. The wider edges represent more collaborations between a particular artist and a producer. The nodes that are larger indicate that the producer worked with more of the artists</p>

<p>The visualization represents 9,009 songs that were collected from the <a href="https://docs.genius.com">Genius API</a> using <a href="https://github.com/umd-mith/geniusing/blob/master/collect-data.ipynb">this</a> Jupyter Notebook.  It is important to note that only 111 out of 162 (68%) of the artists listed at Wikipedia were found in Genius. If you would like to visualize the data you can download the Cytograph <a href="session.cys">session file</a>, the <a href="edges.csv">edge list</a>, or the <a href="songs.csv">song data</a> that was used.</p> </section>
